# Book-Like
Information on book-like frameworks and features for the web.

A community collect of info on different frameworks for making books on the web. Mainly flat file systems, multi-format typeseting, pipelines. Part of the objective being about being interoperable, making content reusable, sharing ideas to add to different frameworks - rather than being about one framework being better than the other.

The second part if then to filter out features that are good to have in the different frameworks to aid in reading, use, and functions of the book.

Any questions raise and issue or Tweet @pub_con and maintained by @mrchristian99
